const myConcat = (arr1, arr2) => arr1.concat(arr2);

// test your code
console.log(myConcat([1, 2], [3, 4, 5]));

/*
Just like a normal function, you can pass arguments into arrow functions.

    // doubles input value and returns it
    const doubler = (item) => item * 2;

You can pass more than one argument into arrow functions as well.

Rewrite the myConcat function which appends contents of arr2 to arr1 so that the function uses arrow function syntax.

1. User did replace var keyword.
2. myConcat should be a constant variable (by using const).
3. myConcat should be a function
4. myConcat() returns the correct array
5. function keyword was not used.
