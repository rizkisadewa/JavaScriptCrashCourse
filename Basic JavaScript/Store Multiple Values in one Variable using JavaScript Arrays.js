// Example
var ourArray = ["John", 23];

// Only change code below this line.
var myArray = ["Rizki", 25];


/*
With JavaScript array variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:

var sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"].

Modify the new array myArray so that it contains both a string and a number (in that order).

Hint
Refer to the example code in the text editor if you get stuck.

1. myArray should be an array.
2. The first item in myArray should be a string.
3. The second item in myArray should be a number
